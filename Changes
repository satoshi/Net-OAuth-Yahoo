Revision history for Net-OAuth-Yahoo

1.0.0   2016/12/27
        Fixing sim_present_auth to use form_number as Yahoo changed the login page (credit goes to Roman P).
        Changing to semantic versioning, bumping the major version because 0.06 is v0.60.0 normalized, and I'm not
        making the new version 0.61.0.

        Fixing version info as I forgot to update one place.
